Bindings for [PipeWire](https://pipewire.org)

# Overview

This crate provides Rust wrappers for the PipeWire APIs.

The main goal is to cover as many as possible PipeWire functionality with less code using macro and traits for unification.

# Status

The library is not finished and not tested properly.

If you are looking for stable bindings, check the [pipewire-rs](https://crates.io/crates/pipewire) crate.

# Contributing

Any help is welcome.
